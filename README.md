# Dynamic-Array
Dynamic Array implemented in C. All public methods are in the header file. 

For the constructor, you must pass in a function that knows how to display the data you are storing. For example, lets say you want to pass in some integers. You would create an Integer class, and a method of that class would be displayInteger. The function signature should look as follows:
```
void displayInteger(FILE *, void *);
```
